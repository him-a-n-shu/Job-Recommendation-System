# Job Recommendation System

> The Job Recommendation System is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of machine learning with a simple and effective user interface to provide tailored job recommendations based on user input.

## Overview:
The Job Recommendation System is a web application designed to help users find job recommendations based on their selected job roles or specific skill sets. The system leverages machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to provide relevant job suggestions. The project is built using Python with Flask for the web framework and integrates a simple and intuitive user interface.


## Features:

**Job Role-Based Recommendations:**  Users can select a specific job role from a dropdown menu to get a list of recommended jobs that are similar to the selected role.

**Skills-Based Recommendations:**  Users can input a list of skills, and the system will provide job recommendations that match the entered skills.

## Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used for implementing the recommendation logic.
Flask: A lightweight web framework used to build the web application and handle HTTP requests.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, including TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity calculations.
HTML/CSS: For creating the structure and styling of the web pages.

## Project Structure:

**app.py:** The main Flask application file that defines routes, processes input data, and renders templates.
**templates/index.html:** The HTML template for the home page where users can select their recommendation type and input data.
**templates/results.html:** The HTML template for displaying the recommended jobs based on the user's input.

## How It Works:

**Home Page:** When users visit the home page, they are presented with a form where they can select between job role-based or skills-based recommendations.

**Input Data:** Depending on the selection, users either choose a job role from a dropdown menu or enter a comma-separated list of skills.

**Recommendation Logic:** Upon form submission, the system processes the input data using the appropriate recommendation function:
For job role-based recommendations, the system calculates similarity between job descriptions using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
For skills-based recommendations, the system filters jobs that match the entered skills and calculates similarity for more precise recommendations.

**Results Page:** The recommended jobs are displayed in a table format, showing the job role, industry, description, and required skills.

## Use Cases:

**Job Seekers:** Individuals looking for job opportunities that align with their current role or skill set can use the system to discover relevant job openings.

**Career Advisors:** Professionals helping clients or students find suitable job roles based on their skills and interests.

**Recruiters:** HR professionals and recruiters can utilize the system to match candidates with job roles that require specific skill sets.

## Future Enhancements:
**User Authentication:** Adding user accounts to save preferences and track recommendations.

**Advanced Filtering:** Implementing additional filters such as location, salary range, and experience level.

**Real-Time Data Integration:** Integrating with job listing APIs to provide real-time job openings and updates.
